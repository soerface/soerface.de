Installing the current project: soerface-de (0.1.0)

Error: The current project could not be installed: Readme path `/home/runner/work/soerface.de/soerface.de/README.md` does not exist.
If you do not want to install the current project use --no-root.
If you want to use Poetry only for dependency management but not for packaging, you can disable package mode by setting package-mode = false in your pyproject.toml file.
If you did intend to install the current project, you may need to set `packages` in your pyproject.toml file.
