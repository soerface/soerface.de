title: Post-production with ffmpeg
teaser: >
    `ffmpeg` may not be very intuitive to use â€“ but it can remove a lot of repetitive work when using
    it in bash scripts. I'll show you how I automated syncing two videos, combining them, and adding
    an intro and outro to the result. [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/),
    [mpv](https://mpv.io/) and [sox](http://sox.sourceforge.net/) are also part of the toolchain.
